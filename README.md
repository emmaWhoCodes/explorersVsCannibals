# explorersVsCannibals

This is the common problem where there are 3 explorers and 3 cannibals on one side of the river and 
they want to travel to the other side. The boat can only hold 2 people at a time, and if the cannibals ever outnumber
the explorers on either side of the river, the cannibal will eat the explorer and the game is over.
